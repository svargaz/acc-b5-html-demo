	<p>Caesar and his train approach the Senate. 
		He sees the soothsayer in the crowd and confidently declares, "The ides of March are come" (1).
		"Ay, Caesar; but not gone" (2), replies the soothsayer. 
		Artemidorus is also on the street and he pleads with Caesar to read his scroll. 
		But Caesar ignores him and enters the Senate. 
		Cassius approaches him with a request to overturn a previous ruling and let a banished countrymen return home. 
		Caesar answers with a flavoured speech, informing Cassius that 
		"I was constant Cimber should be banish'd/And constant do remain to keep him so"
